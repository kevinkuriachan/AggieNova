Type 1A: (2007af)
 white dwarf explode , creates radioactive nikel (half life ~ 7 days)
 the amount of energy being given off exponentially decreases 
 brightness ~ (T^4) * (r^2) 
 supernova getting bigger: r^2 explanding quadratically 
 temperature decreasing: 
 radioactive nikel still giving off some heat as supernova grows
 each time we look at it, we see a deeper layer becuase outer ones have gone out
 relatively cool, lots of iron 

Type II: (2006bp)
 huge
 big explosion 
 hydrogen around it gets ionized and loses electrons 
 starts off hot, blue 
 rapid cooling:
	UV brightness going down
	optical less sensitive to temp, more on size
	V band lasts a 100 days because it gets electrons as it loses energy
 relatively hot, lots of hydrogen
